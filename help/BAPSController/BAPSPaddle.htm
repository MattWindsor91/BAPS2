<h1>BAPS Paddle</h1>

<h2><a name="news">News Mode</a></h2>

<h2><a name="playback">Playback Mode</a></h2>
In this mode each pair of buttons controls one of the three channels. The top button on each row plays whatever is currently loaded in the channel and the bottom row of buttons will either stop playback (if something is playing) or load the next item in the playlist if there is nothing playing.<br />
