There are two ways to add audio into your track lists.
<ol>
<li>
The first is to use audio from the <a name="predefined">predefined</a> audio collections at the top of the interface:<br />
<br />
<img src="AudioCollection.gif" alt="Audio Collection"><br />
You can click and drag items from the Audio Collections and drop them into any of your track lists. They will always add themselves to the end of the list. You can then <a href="manageEntries.htm">move them</a> to the desired position.<br />
The long thin button above each Audio Collection refreshes the list and will retrieve any recently added items<br />
</li>
<li>
The second method is to add tracks from the <a name="musiclibrary">Music Library</a>.<br/>
To do this click the button marked 'Search Record Library':<br /><br />
<img src="searchLibrary.gif" alt="Search Record Library"><br /><br />
This will open the search form which you can use to find your desired track:<br /><br/>
<img src="searchForm.gif" alt="Search Form"><br /><br />
Type in the name of an artist and/or a track title and click search. You do not have to type the full artist or track title and you may use '%' as a wildcard if you do not know exactly how to spell a name.<br />
For example:<br />
Entering: fre%erc in the artist box and clicking search will find all the tracks by Freddy Mercury, the middle letters of his name being filled in automatically.<br /><br />
Search terms are case InSeNsItIvE. You will get a maximum of 200 search results, if you receive 200 results then it is likely that there are more tracks that meet your criteria. Click 'Search Again' to find the next 200 tracks.<br /><br/>
You can also sort your results by selecting the appropriate radio button. If you order by date added then the reverse order box will automatically be checked so that the most recently added music will appear at the top of your list. When ordering by 'date added' you do not have to have any text in the artist or title boxes but for any other ordering you must enter something in one field.<br /><br />
To find all tracks by queen such that the most recently added are at the top you would enter: 'queen' in the artist box and select order by 'date added' and click search.<br />
To find the most recently added music you would just select order by 'date added' and click search.<br /><br />

Once you have found the track that you want you select it by clicking on it and then choose which list to add it to using the large buttons at the bottom of the form. Once you have got all of your audio use the close button at the top of the form to close the search page.
