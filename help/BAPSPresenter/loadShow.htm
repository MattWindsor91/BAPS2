<h1>Loading a Show</h1>
Using the <a href="../BAPSWebShowManMain.htm">BAPS Web Show Manager</a> website you can create your entire show ready to load in BAPS Presenter.<br /><br />
To load a show first click on the Load Show button on the interfaace:<br/><br/>
<img src="loadShowButton.gif" alt="Load Show Button"><br /><br/>
<h2><a name="user">Enter user details</a></h2>
This will open the show loader. You must then enter your details to get a list of your shows:<br/><br/>

In general you will need to select other user and enter the BAPS username that you created your show using. If you are unsure which username you should use then you can find it in the top right hand corner of the BAPS Web Show Manager interface when editing your show.<br />
By default you will see all your shows that you set to be broadcast at any time up to 3 hours before the current time. If you need to load a show that happened further back in time that than you must de-select the checkbox saying new shows only.
<h2><a name="show">Choose a show</a></h2>
You are next confronted with a list of shows you have created. Select one and click go:<br/><br/>

<h2><a name="channels">Select the channels</a></h2>
The final part of loading a show will normally be set correctly and you don't need to worry about it. By default it will match each of your lists with the channel you specified for that list. If you wish to put lists on different channels or not load some lists then you must alter the selections.<br />
All of the lists in the show you are loading appear down the left hand side and the available channels appear accross the top. You can select a maximum of one list to go in each channel although you can assign as many lists as you wish to the '-' channel which will cause that list not to load:<br /><br/>

The final option on this form is to indicate whether you wish to clear a channel's existing list before loading the new one. By default the list will be cleared. Clearing a list DOES NOT affect any track currently playing, the playing track will remain after the rest of the list has been cleared.
