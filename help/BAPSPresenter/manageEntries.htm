<h1>Manage track list entries</h1>
The track list is the most important part of the Presenter interface. You can use it to order your tracks, load audio and load textual entries. The following diagram shows what all the visual elements mean:<br/><br />
<img src="trackList.gif" alt="Track List"><br /><br />
<h2><a name="moving">Moving entries around</a></h2>
To move an entry just drag it from its current position to a new position. Doing this will not affect any audio that is playing, you can even move the track that is playing.<br />
<h2><a name="delete">Deleting an entry</a></h2>
You can delete an entry in ways:<br />
<ol>
<li>Delete loaded entry<br />
When a track list has focus (as shown by a red highlight) you can push the delete key to delete the currently loaded track. You can only deleted a loaded track if it is not playing.
</li>
<li>Delete any entry using the mouse<br />
If you right click on an entry you can select delete to delete the entry the mouse is over:<br /><br />

</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="resetchannel">Reset a Channel</a></h2>
When finished with BAPS you can reset each of your channels so that the playlists are cleared and all settings are put back to defaults. Choose the reset channel option to do this. In certain circumstances resetting a channel may resolve temporary audio problems such as audio running faster or slower than it normally should. When resetting a channel any track currently playing will not be removed. If there is a playing track the settings will also not get reset to default.
