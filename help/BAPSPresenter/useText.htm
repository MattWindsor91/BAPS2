<h1>Using textual entries</h1>
A show can be prepared such that it includes textual entries which may be links between tracks, news stories or a show script. This can only be done using the <a href="../BAPSWebShowManMain.htm">BAPS Web Show Manager</a> website<br /><br />
See <a href="loadShow.htm">Loading a Show</a> for information on how to load a show created using BAPS Web Show Manager.<br /><br />
<h2><a name="viewing">Viewing Textual entries</a></h2>
Textual entries appear with a 'T' icon next to them in the track list. See <a href="manageEntries.htm">Managing track list entries</a> for descriptions of all the track list icons. To display a textual entry click on it, this will not interfere with playback.<br /><br />
When loaded a textual entry will get a black icon next to it and the text will load into the bottom section of the interface.<br /><br />
The text is editable but changes will be lost when a new textual entry is loaded.<br /><br />
<h2><a name="textwindow">Open/Close Text Window</a></h2>
If you need more space to read the textual entry you can open a text reader window by pushing Ctrl+n. If you then move this window to another screen (if you have multiple monitors) and then push Ctrl+shift+n, The screen will maximise. Pushing Ctrl+shift+n again will restore the window to its orginal size. Pushing Ctrl+n again will close the text reader.<br /><br/>
n.b. The chat feature must be off to use the small text reader included in the main interface.
