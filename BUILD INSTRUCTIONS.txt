***BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR VS2017***

The issues below should now be gone, since BAPS.lib has been integrated back into the regular project file.

The custom diaglogs for BAPSSetup are no longer required.

To build BAPSSetup, you will need to install the following (or equivalent for your version of VS):

Actually worked on 06/May/2015

-- If it complains about lacking certain executables or libraries during build, the paths must be modified.

--Go to Tool -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories -> Executable files.

-- Add C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bin

-- Then -> Library files. Add C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1A\Lib



-- BAPSSetup fails to build

EDIT V2.7.1 (November 2018)- This dialog is replaced with standard radio button templates, this should no longer be required.

This seems to use some setup dialogue frames etc - BAPS has a custom one which it used to copy into
Program Files (!).
In the post WinXP days, this isn't really feasible so it must be put there manually.

The file VsdServiceCredentials1Dlg.wid needs copying to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\Tools\Deployment\VsdDialogs\0 and 1033.
The entire (yes, entire) VsdDialogs path may also need
 copying to the not-x86 path. Maybe the other way around.
